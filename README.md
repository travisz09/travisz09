Hello world!
<br><br>
My name is Travis Zalesky, and this is my personal github page.
<br><br>
I am an ecologist, and a research scientist with 10+ years of experience. You can check out my <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-zalesky-5793b9262/>LinkedIn</a> profile or take a look at my <a href=https://github.com/travisz09/travisz09/blob/main/Travis_Zalesky_CV.pdf>resume</a>.
<br><br>
I am interested in <em>Climate Science</em> and <em>Data Science</em>. I am especially interested in combining these two fields, using big data to help manage resources, protect our environment, and inform environmental policy.
<br><br>
I have been collecting and analyzing ecological data for over a decade, and have specialized in use of R for data anaysis and figure generation. You can view my course certifications and development projects <a href=https://www.freecodecamp.org/fcc9b9bb9b6-c7dd-422f-b22a-7f7c246d1985>freeCodeCamp</a>, <a href=https://github.com/travisz09/travisz09/blob/main/Travis_Zalesky_Transcript_01062026.pdf>ESRI</a>, my personal <a href=https://sites.google.com/view/traviszaleskyprojectportfolio/home?authuser=0>project portfolio</a>, as well as certain other projects hosted in my <a href=https://github.com/travisz09?tab=repositories>github repository</a>. 
<br><br>
I am currently working on pursuing my PhD in <a href=https://oceans.asu.edu/graduate/ocean-futures-phd/>Ocean Futures</a> at <a href=https://www.asu.edu/>Arizona State University</a>, researching Arctic ice dynamics and remote sensing.
<br><br>
I hope to be able to share more of my original code, particularly in R, with the github community, and I would be happy to collaborate with anyone on ecologically focused data analysis.
